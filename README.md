`deployfish` has commands for managing the whole lifecycle of your application:

* Safely and easily create, update, destroy and restart ECS services
* Extensive support for ECS related services like load balancing, application
  autoscaling and service discovery
* Easily scale the number of containers in your service, optionally scaling its
  associated autoscaling group at the same time
* Manage multiple environments for your service (test, qa, prod, etc.) in
  multiple AWS accounts.
* Uses AWS Parameter Store for secrets for your containers
* View the configuration and status of running ECS services
* Run a one-off command related to your service
* Easily exec through your VPC bastion host into your running containers, or
  ssh into a ECS container machine in your cluster.
* Setup SSH tunnels to the private AWS resources in VPC that your service
  uses so that you can connect to them from your work machine.

* Extensible! Add additional functionality through custom deployfish modules.
* Works great in CodeBuild steps in a CodePipeline based CI/CD system!


Additionally, `deployfish` integrates with
[terraform](https://www.terraform.io) state files so that you can use the
values of terraform outputs directly in your `deployfish` configurations.

To use `deployfish`, you

* Install `deployfish`
* Define your service in `deployfish.yml`
* Use `deploy` to start managing your service

A simple `deployfish.yml` looks like this:

    services:
      - name: my-service
        environment: prod
        cluster: my-cluster
        count: 2
        load_balancer:
          service_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123142123547:role/ecsServiceRole
          load_balancer_name: my-service-elb
          container_name: my-service
          container_port: 80
        family: my-service
        network_mode: bridge
        task_role_arn: arn:aws:iam::123142123547:role/myTaskRole
        containers:
          - name: my-service
            image: 123142123547.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-service:0.0.1
            cpu: 128
            memory: 256
            memoryReservation: 128
            ports:
              - "80"
            environment:
              - ENVIRONMENT=prod
              - ANOTHER_ENV_VAR=value
              - THIRD_ENV_VAR=value

## Documentation

[deployfish.readthedocs.io](http://deployfish.readthedocs.io/) is the full
reference for deployfish, including a full `deployfish.yml` reference and
tutorials.


## Installing deployfish

deployfish is a pure python package.  As such, it can be installed in the
usual python ways.  For the following instructions, either install it into your
global python install, or use a python [virtual environment](https://python-guide-pt-br.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) to install it
without polluting your global python environment.

### Install via pip

    pip install deployfish

### Install via `setup.py`

Download a release from [Github](https://github.com/caltechads/deployfish/releases), then:

    unzip deployfish-0.26.0.zip
    cd deployfish-0.26.0
    python setup.py install

Or:

    git clone https://github.com/caltechads/deployfish.git
    cd deployfish
    python setup.py install

### Using pyenv to install into a virtual environment (Recommended)

If you use python and frequently need to install additional python modules,
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and [pyenv-virtualenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv)
are extremely useful.  They allow some very useful things:

* Manage your virtualenvs easily on a per-project basis
* Provide support for per-project Python versions.

To install `pyenv` and `pyenv-virtualenv` and set up your environment for the
first time
